## What is the OBIS Products Catalog?

The OBIS Products Catalog is a centralized metadata repository that helps users discover and access data products created from OBIS-mediated marine biodiversity data. As the OBIS network has grown, it became challenging to track the diverse products—from maps and models to publications and software—that researchers have created. This catalog provides a searchable, well-organized metadata registry with semantic web capabilities.
