## Why We Created This Catalog

### The Challenge

As the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) network has grown to encompass 38 regional and thematic nodes and 668 institutions worldwide, researchers have created an incredible variety of data products from OBIS-mediated marine biodiversity data. These products include:

- Scientific publications and reports
- Interactive maps and dashboards
- Statistical models and analyses
- Data visualizations and infographics
- Derived and aggregated datasets
- Software tools and applications
- Educational materials

However, these products were scattered across institutional repositories, personal websites, and various data platforms, making it difficult for the community to discover and access them.

### The Solution

The OBIS Products Catalog provides a **centralized metadata registry** that serves as a focal point for discovering OBIS-related data products. Rather than requiring researchers to maintain metadata in multiple places, the catalog:

- **Aggregates metadata** from existing sources (Zenodo, institutional repositories)
- **Links to authoritative sources** (OBIS nodes, Ocean Expert institutions)
- **Exposes machine-readable metadata** via JSON-LD for semantic web integration
- **Provides a unified search interface** with faceted filtering

This approach minimizes the maintenance burden on product creators while maximizing discoverability.

### Community Governance

The catalog is developed and maintained by the **OBIS Products Coordination Group (PCG)**, which coordinates data and information products that synthesize and generate new information from OBIS-hosted data. The PCG meets bimonthly and welcomes participation from the OBIS community.

For more information, see the [OBIS Manual](https://manual.obis.org/nodes.html#obis-products-coordination-group) or contact [helpdesk@obis.org](mailto:helpdesk@obis.org).

## Understanding the Data Model

The catalog organizes metadata using three main entities that reflect the OBIS organizational structure:

### OBIS Nodes (Organizations)

**What they are:** The 38 regional and thematic nodes that form the OBIS network.

**Examples:**
- OBIS USA
- EurOBIS (European node)
- Antarctic OBIS
- Caribbean OBIS
- Ocean Tracking Network (OTN)

**How they work in the catalog:**
- Each node is represented as an **Organization** in CKAN
- Products are associated with the node(s) that stewarded the underlying data
- Node metadata is synchronized from the OBIS API
- Organizations are prefixed with `node-` (e.g., `node-obis-usa`) to avoid naming conflicts

**Data Source:** [https://api.obis.org/v3/node](https://api.obis.org/v3/node)

### OBIS Institutions (Groups)

**What they are:** The 668+ research institutions, universities, and organizations that contribute data to OBIS.

**Examples:**
- CSIRO National Collections
- Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ)
- Ocean Tracking Network
- Alfred Wegener Institute

**How they work in the catalog:**
- Each institution is represented as a **Group** in CKAN
- Products can be tagged with relevant institutions
- Institution metadata is enriched with data from Ocean Expert, including:
  - Contact information (email, phone, address)
  - Geographic location and region
  - Institution type and activities
  - Website and social media links
  - Acronyms and alternative names

**Data Sources:** 
- [https://api.obis.org/v3/institute](https://api.obis.org/v3/institute)
- [https://oceanexpert.org/api/v1/institute/](https://oceanexpert.org/api/v1/institute/)

**Data Quality Indicators:**
- `ocean_expert_full` - Complete Ocean Expert metadata retrieved
- `ocean_expert_partial` - Partial Ocean Expert data available
- `obis_only` - Only OBIS data available (Ocean Expert unavailable)

### Relationship Between Nodes and Institutions

**Nodes** (Organizations) are the data stewardship entitiesâ€”they manage, curate, and publish datasets to OBIS. Products in the catalog are **owned by** nodes.

**Institutions** (Groups) are the research entities that produce the data and products. Products can be **tagged with** multiple institutions to show all contributors.

**Example:** A publication analyzing Arctic fish distributions might be:
- **Owned by:** node-arctic-obis (the steward of Arctic data)
- **Tagged with:** University of Alaska Fairbanks, Norwegian Polar Institute (the research institutions)

This structure mirrors how OBIS itself organizes data and reflects real-world collaborations.

## JSON-LD and Semantic Web

### What is JSON-LD?

JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a method of encoding linked data using JSON. It allows the catalog to expose metadata in a format that machines can understand and reason about.

### Why It Matters

**For researchers:**
- Your products become part of the semantic web
- Metadata can be automatically harvested by search engines and discovery services
- Links between products, datasets, and researchers are machine-readable

**For the community:**
- Enables automated aggregation of OBIS products across platforms
- Facilitates integration with other marine data infrastructures (e.g., ODIS, EDMO)
- Supports FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

### How It Works

Every dataset in the catalog has a JSON-LD endpoint that follows the [Schema.org](https://schema.org) vocabulary with ODIS extensions:

**Endpoint format:**
```
https://products.obis.org/dataset/{dataset-name}/odis.jsonld
```

**Example:**
```
https://products.obis.org/dataset/arctic-fish-distributions/odis.jsonld
```

### What's Included in JSON-LD

The JSON-LD export includes:

- **Basic metadata:** Title, description, keywords, publication date
- **Authors and contributors:** Names, affiliations, ORCID identifiers
- **Organizations:** ROR identifiers for institutional affiliations
- **Identifiers:** DOI, URLs, canonical identifiers
- **Spatial coverage:** Geographic bounding boxes, place names
- **Temporal coverage:** Time periods covered by the product
- **Funding:** Grant information and funding agencies
- **Related resources:** Citations, source datasets, derived products

### Schema.org + ODIS

The catalog uses [Schema.org](https://schema.org) as the base vocabulary (widely recognized by search engines like Google Scholar) and extends it with [ODIS (Ocean Data and Information System)](https://book.oceaninfohub.org/) properties for marine-specific metadata.

**Standard Schema.org types used:**
- `Dataset` - For data products
- `ScholarlyArticle` - For publications
- `SoftwareSourceCode` - For software
- `CreativeWork` - For other products

**ODIS extensions include:**
- Marine ecosystem types
- Ocean regions and features
- Oceanographic parameters
- Marine species identifiers

### Using JSON-LD

**For web developers:**
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
  <!-- Embed JSON-LD in your web page -->
</script>
```

**For harvesters:**
```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/ld+json" \
  https://products.obis.org/dataset/dataset-name/odis.jsonld
```

**For validation:**
- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Schema.org Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)
